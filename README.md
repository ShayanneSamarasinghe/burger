# Burger Logger


## Usage 
This application allows users to type in a burger that they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. The database stores each logged burger within a database
